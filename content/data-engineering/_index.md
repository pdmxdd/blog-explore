A friend turned me on to a local bootcamp for data engineering.

I'm interested and confident I can work through it on my own using the resources of the program.

I'm documenting my journey here.

The course includes:

- scala
- kafka
- HBase
- Spark
- Final Project to Tie Everything together

I've never used any of these tools, but am aware of what each of them do.

I'll go through the courses project materials and probably supplement it on my own.
