## Welcome

Welcome to my **explore** blog. I learn most effectively by *doing* and *exploring*.

This is where I actively *explore* projects, concepts, really anything in tech that interests me.

I have no agenda, I have no plan, I just like learning and sharing what I learn with others.

I have a lot of experience in both technical curriculum development and teaching. If anything in this blog hits all the right notes I will more than likely move it to a more formalized course. But no promises.

## About Me

I'm Paul Matthews.

Professionally, I'm a programmer, Linux enthusiast, DevOps dabbler, curriculum developer, learner and teacher.

Personally, I'm a husband, father, nerd, tech enthusiast, cook, learner, teacher and more.
